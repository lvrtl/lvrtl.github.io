I was once lost in the densest woods I have ever known. Every tree a wall, enforcing a maze, suppressing thought in vastness.

Turn and turn and turn, see the world spin. I saw no way out. But I kept going. Because, where else is there to go but forward?

I ended up giving up on escaping the forest. And yet I continued. I saw the trees, bearing, in subtlety. As I saw the,
I saw their splits, their creaking characters. The timber of their groans resonated with me. I saw the tumbling
sea of roots beneath my feet and gasped, a maw awed by this ancient tensing. And yet, how selective these were!
Arms above loosening to brushes upon sound. This place was self walling against the worldly blustering that assaults
most our trees and yet a subtlety remained. Almost louder in the softness it stirred.

Can you hear it about you?

Its hard, when so much is fighting, to hear and see a gentle surrender. And so I too was awfully exposed to nature's ability to align as it does.

I submitted to the maze, saw not just it but the stir in my heart towards its veins. Its intimate distance. I flung myself through
rustles and gaps, bark a peripheral spread. I flew in a state of fever. It could've gone on forever and I would've known
life until death.

As hunger approached and became me, stepping into my form, the vigor of my fever began to seep
lucidity. The fever became not a fuel but an indistinguishability. Thirst began to blur me.

Was I really knowing life any more? It was certainly a transformed face, merged with my own. But lived so fully. My will was beyond escape, but rather
to embodying that which I found bestowed in me. As I slowed, the horror of the ailen land about me seeped at my edges,
a periphery desperately pushed against eating at my sight. The leaning returned to me with such self evidence that
my heart held no doubt of the delusions of my past witnessing of neutrality. The world spiralled again, and I cast my
knees down. My eyes beheld the obscured sky above me. Speckles of white and blue over shards of dark verdancy with kaleidoscopic
hypnotism. I was soothed to this fresh truth of intoxication. I was ready to give over. I felt myself sink down and up and I knew
I was ready. That I'd learned all had to. That it was OK to let go. As I sank deeper and deeper, I felt my limbs diverge, arms lightening and legs lead. I felt myself grow immobile,
my nature re-found. Re-founded.

Did the forest move for me or did I move it? I kept my gaze upon this sanctuary and saw my fingers above me, splayed
and beautiful. Strong limbs, deep veins. I have never known unity as strong since then.

But as my eyes adjusted to the fingers upon my field of vision, I was cruelly reminded of my misalignment. Out of place, irreconcilable with these ancient things. In seeing my own foreignness, my mirroring to this place, I knew it time time to go. With gratitude for these
gorgeous, cutting figures, I followed the path that now seemed so obvious, the way that felt repulsive to my body, that was shown as the vomiting out, an autoimmune response. I felt myself held high in my foggy clarity and stumbled out to my future.
